You should start preparing for job hunting as soon as you can. Start when you're in
- Middle School 
- High School 
- College
- Trade School

Anytime you do anything that you're proud of (or your family is proud of) should be documented and saved for potential use in getting a job. 

- Did you manage the Ski Team in High school? It could show responsibility and leadership if so. 
- Were you on the Constitutional Law debate team? Public speaking and thinking on your feet.- Were you on the Formula Racing Team and manufacture carbon fiber parts? Tenacity, iteration and engineering design
- Were you a Martial Arts instructor with black belt? Tenacity and leadership
