The first day at work can be overwhelming, with identity checks, contracts to sign and forms to fill out. 

You should bring the following items:

- Proof of Identity - state issued identification or national passport
- Social Security Number
- Proof of Citizenship or Work Permit


Once you've landed the job you want, you've got a lot of decisions to make on your first day of work. 

1. Fill out your IRS Form W-2
2. You might have to sign an employment contract or a non-disclosure form
3. Health Insurance
3. Sign up for the 401K
